    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe teacher incentive programs in Article 1 sound good at first, but they end up creating several big problems that make education worse. These problems are shown in the “Table of Codes for Bad Results We Will Actually Get” below.\nThe Master Teacher Money Problem:\nThe program promises to reward the best teachers with bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $36,000. But these bonuses will, in the long run, make teachers care more about money than actually teaching (Code A shows up in 89% of the incentives). Instead of focusing on teaching, teachers will naturally start acting for the money, which hurts the students who need great teaching the most.\nThe Performance Pay Trick:\nPerformance pay systems try to reward good teachers by giving them different pay scales. But in this case they end up making standardized tests and rankings more important than fixing the real problems that teachers face. They are extrinsic motivators. This causes districts to waste huge amounts of money on rankings, while the systemic problems stay the same.\nThe Teamwork Destroyer:\nTeacher incentive programs claim to improve teaching by offering rewards, but they actually make teachers compete against each other for a small amount of money (Code B appears in 64% of the incentives). Instead of working together to improve education, teachers are forced to compete, which destroys teamwork, something schools really need.\nThe Local Control Takeover:\nWhile these programs seem to support local school innovation, 57% of them actually take away control from local districts (Code F). They force districts to follow state-designed evaluation systems, teacher placement rules, and standard performance measures, leaving communities with little say in their own education decisions.\nThe Small District Trap:\nBonuses meant to help small, poor districts keep experienced teachers ($5,000-$10,000) actually will likely end up creating even bigger problems. These policies increase state dependency (Code C), add administrative burdens (Code E), and reduce flexibility (Code F). Small districts may end up spending more on compliance than they actually get in incentive funding.\nThe Blame Game Problem:\nPrograms that aim to improve education by tough teacher evaluations and strategic teacher placement end up blaming teachers for problems instead of fixing the systems that cause them (Code G appears in 50% of the incentives). This policy aims to ‘fix’ individual teachers rather than addressing the bigger issues created by the system in which they work.\nThe Professional Growth Killer:\nPrograms that encourage National Board Certification and professional development seem to help teachers grow professionally. But, no amount of certification can overcome the limitations placed on districts by central planning from Austin (Code A shows up here).\nSummary\nThese problems shows legislation that cannot actually improve education. Instead, it’s focused on control mechanisms disguised as teacher support. The policies are like training animals with rewards and punishments. They assume teachers care only about money, not the real purpose of teaching.\nIn the end, these policies hurt motivation, teamwork, and the systems that actually help students learn. They also create financial obligations and red tape that force districts to beg for money every couple of years. This ultimately harms everyone, especially the students these policies claim to help."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe teacher incentive programs in Article 1 sound good at first, but they end up creating several big problems that make education worse. These problems are shown in the “Table of Codes for Bad Results We Will Actually Get” below.\nThe Master Teacher Money Problem:\nThe program promises to reward the best teachers with bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $36,000. But these bonuses will, in the long run, make teachers care more about money than actually teaching (Code A shows up in 89% of the incentives). Instead of focusing on teaching, teachers will naturally start acting for the money, which hurts the students who need great teaching the most.\nThe Performance Pay Trick:\nPerformance pay systems try to reward good teachers by giving them different pay scales. But in this case they end up making standardized tests and rankings more important than fixing the real problems that teachers face. They are extrinsic motivators. This causes districts to waste huge amounts of money on rankings, while the systemic problems stay the same.\nThe Teamwork Destroyer:\nTeacher incentive programs claim to improve teaching by offering rewards, but they actually make teachers compete against each other for a small amount of money (Code B appears in 64% of the incentives). Instead of working together to improve education, teachers are forced to compete, which destroys teamwork, something schools really need.\nThe Local Control Takeover:\nWhile these programs seem to support local school innovation, 57% of them actually take away control from local districts (Code F). They force districts to follow state-designed evaluation systems, teacher placement rules, and standard performance measures, leaving communities with little say in their own education decisions.\nThe Small District Trap:\nBonuses meant to help small, poor districts keep experienced teachers ($5,000-$10,000) actually will likely end up creating even bigger problems. These policies increase state dependency (Code C), add administrative burdens (Code E), and reduce flexibility (Code F). Small districts may end up spending more on compliance than they actually get in incentive funding.\nThe Blame Game Problem:\nPrograms that aim to improve education by tough teacher evaluations and strategic teacher placement end up blaming teachers for problems instead of fixing the systems that cause them (Code G appears in 50% of the incentives). This policy aims to ‘fix’ individual teachers rather than addressing the bigger issues created by the system in which they work.\nThe Professional Growth Killer:\nPrograms that encourage National Board Certification and professional development seem to help teachers grow professionally. But, no amount of certification can overcome the limitations placed on districts by central planning from Austin (Code A shows up here).\nSummary\nThese problems shows legislation that cannot actually improve education. Instead, it’s focused on control mechanisms disguised as teacher support. The policies are like training animals with rewards and punishments. They assume teachers care only about money, not the real purpose of teaching.\nIn the end, these policies hurt motivation, teamwork, and the systems that actually help students learn. They also create financial obligations and red tape that force districts to beg for money every couple of years. This ultimately harms everyone, especially the students these policies claim to help."

    "section": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results",
    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe policies in Article 4, which focus on parent-directed services and dyslexia training, seem helpful but actually give more power to the state. These policies are labeled as “parental choice” and “specialized support,” but they end up increasing state control while taking away local decision-making. All the policies are analyzed using a framework to detect likely consequences not intended by the legislature, showing how they will cause harm.\nNot surprisingly, all the policies in these sections increase state dependency (Code C) and reduce local control (Code F). This means that every policy takes power away from local districts and puts it into the hands of state bureaucrats.\nThe Parent Choice Switcher-Roo\nParent-Directed Services Programs promise to give parents more control with state-funded accounts for services, flexible provider choices, and protections for religious freedom. However, these programs make parents more dependent on the state (Code C in 100% of cases) and reduce their independence.\nIt’s like saying, “You can pick any car you want, but only if you get permission from us first and choose from our approved list.” Parents end up with less choice because they have to follow state rules to get the money that should be theirs.\nProvider Freedom Means Getting To Chose, but the State Controls the Options\nThe Provider and Vendor Criteria claim to protect religious freedom and independence by allowing parents to choose their own providers. But these policies actually decrease local control (Code F in 100% of cases) by forcing family-provider relationships into state-approved networks.\nParents who have spent years building trust with their therapists or tutors will lose those relationships when providers can’t or won’t meet state requirements. It’s like needing a government license for babysitters — it harms the natural relationships that actually work.\nThe Dyslexia Training Trap\nThe Dyslexia Teacher Training Grant Program promises $350 million for better teacher training. But this program has the worst issues, including reduced motivation (Code A), more competition (Code B), and massive paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases).\nInstead of improving reading instruction, this creates yet another training industry that makes money off teacher certification requirements, but the money never reaches classrooms. Teachers end up competing for grants instead of working together to help kids learn to read.\nThe Central Planning Approach to Support\nThe Grant Program Implementation aims to help districts that don’t have enough dyslexia resources by providing panels and evidence-based design. But these policies force students into one-size-fits-all programs instead of offering personalized approaches (Code G and Code C).\nIronically, the policies that claim to build local resources actually remove the local flexibility needed for timely interventions that match each child’s unique needs.\nThe Religious Liberty Lawyers Relief Act\nThe Participant Autonomy Protections promise to protect religious freedom with non-interference language and burden-of-proof rules. But these protections come with huge administrative burdens (Code E in 100% of cases), which hurt families more than help them.\nInstead of protecting religious freedom, these policies create a system where families need lawyers to exercise their rights. It’s like needing a law degree just to go to church.\nThe Loss of Parental Control\nThe Final Determination Authority promises to make program decisions faster by giving the state commissioner the final say, eliminating the appeals process. But this means parents lose their ability to disagree with state decisions (Code F in 100% of cases). This is a terrible thing.\nParents who have worked with schools to support their children’s needs will now have to follow state-run systems with no way to appeal poor decisions. It’s like needing federal approval for every family choice with no chance to say no.\nInformation Overload\nThe IEP Committee Information Requirements promise to give parents full details about services and accounts. But these requirements just create more paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases), making the process about forms instead of relationships.\nIt’s like requiring parents to read a manual before they can talk to teachers. These policies assume that families need more rules instead of building relationships with knowledgeable professionals.\nConclusion\nThese policies show a shift from family independence to centralized state control. They take away the flexibility, strong relationships, and individualized programs that are key to effective special education.\nIt’s like trying to improve family meals by requiring the state to approve every recipe. These policies assume that students with disabilities are better served by state regulations than by knowledgeable families working with trusted providers.\nIn the end, these policies undermine local decision-making and create a costly system that benefits consultants and administrators, not students. They cost millions in state funding while helping few students. The real winners are the state bureaucrats who profit from the system, not the families or children who need real support."

    "section": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Financial Control Replaces Local Authority",
    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Financial Control Replaces Local Authority\nThis law fundamentally restructures Texas public education finance to centralize control while creating the illusion of increased funding. Here are the main unintended results:\nFacility Tracking System\nSchools now have to report every square foot of every building, creating a large database of school facilities. This changes schools from local resources to state-monitored buildings. In the future, the state may require schools to use their buildings in certain ways.\nCharter School Funding Rules\nCharter schools get more money, but only if they meet strict financial rules and performance metrics. This creates a system where funding depends more on following state rules than on meeting the educational needs of students. They should have relaxed the requirements on public schools to have parity between public and charter schools. Instead (predictably) they chose to increase central planning on charters as well as public schools.\nCommissioner Gains Power Over School Finances\nThe commissioner now has the power to change funding formulas without needing approval from lawmakers. This temporary power (expiring in 2027) sets a dangerous example for giving more control over school finances to the executive branch, bypassing the normal democratic process. This is an outrageous power to give a political bureaucrat.\nSmall Schools Get Less\nThe extra funding for small districts may seem helpful, but it comes with conditions. The formulas make it hard for small schools to use the funding effectively, forcing them to change enrollment numbers just to meet the requirements, rather than focusing on improving education.\nLanguage Programs Fight for Limited Resources\nLanguage education programs have a statewide funding cap of $10 million, forcing schools to compete for limited money. This will create competitionm for scarce resources. Again, creating artificial scarcity.\nInsurance Costs Create Regional Inequality\nCoastal districts get extra funding to cover insurance costs, which creates a divide between coastal and inland areas. This favors some districts over others, based on where they are located. Good for insurance carriers, bad for school districts.\nThe Biggest Problem: Short-Term Thinking Replaces Long-Term\nThese changes may increase funding for some districts, but they take away the power schools have to decide how to spend that money. Districts will rely on state funding formulas that change every two years, making it impossible for schools to plan for the long term. The state decides who gets what money, when, and why."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: State Control Expansion Through Funding and Regulation\nThis law extends state control deeper and deeper into local education through complex funding mechanisms, teacher qualification mandates, and performance reporting requirements. Here are the main unintended results:\nFunding Creates Dependence on the State\nDistricts get extra money for longer school days and reading programs, but only if they follow state rules and reporting. This will make schools focus more on following the rules than actually improving education. Districts become dependent on the state instead of finding their own solutions.\nTeacher Requirements Limit Local Flexibility\nNew rules for prekindergarten teachers and math training make all schools follow the same standards. These rules don’t take into account what works best for each school. Districts have to follow complicated rules that are unlikely to match the needs of their community or teachers.\nMore Reporting, Less Focus on Students\nChanges to dyslexia screening and reporting add more work for schools with little hope of improving student learning. The focus will shift from helping students learn to just filling out forms and following state rules.\nFixed Plans Don’t Fit Every School\nNew rules for school improvement and turnaround plans require schools to use certain strategies, no matter what the school needs. Schools must follow state-approved plans that might not fix their unique problems or build on what already works well.\nOpen Resources, More State Control\nOpen education resources are meant to give teachers flexible materials, but they come with more state control and reporting. Districts have to use state-approved materials and systems, which limits their ability to choose the best resources for their students and communities.\nFunding Pushes the Wrong Focus\nExtra funding for reading programs and longer school days will push schools to focus on activities that bring in more money, instead of providing a well-rounded education. Districts might expand programs, not because they help students, but because they bring in more funding from the state.\nThe Real Issue\nThese rules make it seem like the state is helping schools, but they actually give the state more control over what schools do. And, that is BAD news for students. They reduce local decision-making, add more paperwork, and make decisions based on one-size-fits-all state rules instead of what students and communities really need.\nLike most of the rest of the new law, these sections promise flexibility while taking away local control and forcing standard solutions."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Ideas, Unintended Results\nThis law creates a huge system of testing and training that takes control away from teachers, parents, and local schools. Here are the main problems:\nTesting Is No Substitute for an Effective Education Process\nYoung kids from kindergarten through third grade now have to take reading and math tests three times each year. The state says this helps find students who need extra help, but really, it’s about controlling what happens in classrooms. Teachers already know which kids need help without the state telling them when to assess it.\nStandardized testing is an attempt to build in quality by inspection. General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet, and the federal government are prime failures of this notion.\nTeachers Lose Control of Their Methods\nAll teachers who teach math from kindergarten through eighth grade must now take state-required training classes. This assumes teachers’ teaching methods aren’t good enough. Teachers who have been successful for years are forced to follow the state’s way of teaching, even if their own methods work better.\nThe Illusion of Choice\nStudents are placed in special reading programs that they “must attend unless exempted.” This sounds like parents have a choice, but in reality, almost all students are put into the same programs. Parents and teachers lose the power to choose what each child really needs.\nThe Grant Money Trap\nThe state offers parents money to pay for tutoring for students who are struggling. This sounds helpful, but it actually makes families rely on state funding instead of fixing the problems in their homes and local schools. Schools will now have to accept any level of quality proferred by state-sponsored tutors.\nMore Rules for Prekindergarten\nThe law adds new rules about who can offer prekindergarten classes and how they must work with outside companies. This makes it much harder for local schools to run their own programs. Schools have to follow state rules even when working with private companies.\nThe “Free” Testing Problem\nThe state provides “free” reading and math tests to schools, but these tests cost schools more in the long run. Schools must spend money on teacher training, reporting, and following new rules. Schools may think they are saving money, but they end up spending much more.\nThe Core Issue\nThese rules make it seem like education is improving, but they actually hurt students by taking away the freedom and local choices that help meaningful learning happen. The state now controls nearly every decision that teachers, parents, and local schools used to make together. This destroys the teamwork and creativity that make schools successful.\nIn the end, early childhood education is being changed from a system that was controlled by local parents and professionals into a state-managed, rules-focused system. This change is likely to make education far less effective while increasing costs and complexity."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Control Through Complex Distribution Mechanisms\nThis law creates elaborate funding schemes that appear to support early education but actually increase state control over local decisions through complex distribution formulas and punitive mechanisms. Here are the main unintended results:\nState Control Through Funding\nThe new funding rules for full-day prekindergarten give the state control over how districts use their resources. Schools must follow state-set rules instead of deciding what works best for their students.\nLimited Choices for Literacy Programs\nThe Early Literacy Intervention funding helps pay for reading programs, but it forces schools to use state-approved methods. This limits schools from choosing the best reading programs for their students. Good for publishers, bad for districts.\nThird Grade Grants Will Punish Schools\nThe Third Grade Supplementary Supports rule says that if students who got grants still fail reading tests in third grade, the district loses future funding. This punishes schools for things they often don’t control and blames teachers instead of addressesing those factors outside teacher control e.g., home environments, discipline, parent preference). This may be the craziest section yet.\nWAY Too Much Paperwork\nThe new rules require schools to track, report, and follow many complicated programs. Schools spend more time filling out forms instead of focusing on teaching. This adds a lot of extra work that takes away from helping students. In the face of all this added bureaucracy, I don’t know why anyone will still want to be a teacher. Teaching is becoming a smaller and smaller part of what ‘teachers’ are expectd to do.\nDetrimental Focus for Schools\nSchools will have to start making decisions based on what brings in the most state money, not what helps students the most. The funding rules push schools to follow certain programs, even if they don’t match the needs of local students or communities.\nState Control Sneaking In Under the Guise of Support\nThese funding rules make schools follow state-approved methods. They give the illusion of more support but actually make schools more controlled by the state instead of being able to respond to local needs.\nThe Real Problem - Central Planning NEVER Improves Anything\nThese rules change early education funding from a system that schools can manage to one controlled by the state. They promise help but actually make schools more dependent on the state. The result is less control for local schools, more paperwork, and decisions based on rules instead of what students actually need."

    "section": "Executive Summary: Good Intentions Will Not Produce Desired Results",
    "text": "Executive Summary: Good Intentions Will Not Produce Desired Results\nThe policies in HB2 Article 2, which focus on teacher preparation and certification, might seem like good ideas, but they can actually hurt teaching. These policies are called “innovative” and “supportive,” but they are likely to cause more problems.\nDistricts Trade ‘Innovation’ for Less Control and More State Power\nInnovation districts are meant to give local schools more freedom by allowing them to skip some teacher certification rules. But in reality, these policies will take away local control (Code F in 48% of cases) and make schools more dependent on the state (Code C in 67% of cases). Schools shouldn’t need permission from the state to make real changes.\nTeacher Shortage ‘Fix’ That Makes Things Worse\nPolicies that let schools hire uncertified teachers and offer $1,000 payments may seem like a fix for teacher shortages. But they treat teachers as the problem, instead of fixing the real issue: the strict rules the state imposes that create false shortages (Code G in 43% of cases). The state causes shortages by making schools follow unnecessary rules and then offers small payments to solve the problem.\nAdvanced Certification: More Money, Less Real Improvement\nPolicies that offer more pay ($3,000-$6,000 extra) for teachers with advanced certifications promise to improve student achievement. But they encourage teachers to collect certifications for the money, not to fix the system they work in (Code A in 67% of cases). This makes teaching about earning money, instead of helping students.\nPartnership Programs Can Waste Resources\nTeacher preparation programs give large amounts of money ($10,000-$24,000 per candidate) to create partnerships between universities and schools. But these programs waste resources and create problems, like increasing state control (Code C), adding more paperwork (Code E in 71% of cases), and taking away local control (Code F). Instead of improving education, the state spends millions on partnerships that fall apart when the funding ends.\nMentorship: Turning Help Into Competition\nMentorship programs give teachers $1,000 for helping new teachers, but they create competition for limited resources (Code B in 24% of cases). Instead of encouraging teamwork, these policies turn mentoring into a way to make extra money. There are already systems that encourage teachers to work together.\nThe Quality of Preparation and Accountability Problem\nPolicies that require “research-based instructional materials” and “evidence-based strategies” for teacher preparation sound good, but they mostly focus on making schools follow rules instead of improving education (Code D in 52% of cases). These policies replace real change with “accountability theater.” Words like “research-based” and “evidence-based” sound important, but they don’t really lead to better teaching.\nLocal Talent Equals More State Control Over Teachers\n“Grow Your Own” programs, which help local districts support high school students and employees who want to become teachers, sound good. But they limit local control (Code F) because the state tells districts exactly how to run these programs. Instead of being a community effort, these programs become another example of following state rules.\nAchievement Academy Turns Learning Into a Checklist\nAchievement academy payments ($500-$1,000) are meant to support professional development, but they turn teaching into a system of rewards (Code A). Eventually, teachers will attend workshops for money, not because they want to learn. These programs feel more like getting credit hours than real opportunities for growth.\nConclusion\nThese policies hurt the development of dedicated teachers. Instead of building on teachers’ passion for teaching, they create a system where teachers focus on collecting certifications and earning rewards. They weaken teamwork between teachers and harm local communities.\nIn the end, these policies don’t help students. They create a costly system that trains teachers to work within a broken system, rather than encouraging creative thinking and real teaching. The only people who benefit are the trainers and consultants."

    "section": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results",
    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThis law about early childhood education creates several problems that hurt what it tries to improve. Here are the main issues:\nThe Charter School Problem\nCharter schools were meant to be different from regular public schools, giving parents more choices. But this law makes charter schools follow the same rules as regular schools. Now, parents only have the option to choose between schools that all do the same things. The idea of “choice” becomes meaningless.\nThe Money Issue for Teachers\nThe law offers teachers extra pay for taking special training classes. While this sounds good, it changes the reason teachers want to improve. Instead of focusing on helping kids, teachers start thinking about the money. When money becomes the main reason to get better, teachers lose the passion for teaching that they had before.\nThe Testing Problem for Young Kids\nKindergarten students now have to take reading tests. The law says this helps find kids who need extra help, but the test scores are sent to the state and used to judge schools. What was supposed to be helpful testing turns into a way to control what happens in classrooms. Young kids feel pressure even before they start real school.\nThe Grant Money Trap\nThe state gives money to schools to help them plan longer school years. But this money really just helps schools get even more state money later. Schools become dependent on state funding instead of finding their own ways to help students. The state uses money to control what schools do.\nThe Illusion of Choice\nKids are “assigned” to special reading programs and have to go unless they are “specifically exempted.” This makes it sound like schools care about each child’s needs. But in reality, all kids are put into the same program, even if it doesn’t work for them. Parents and teachers lose the power to decide what each child really needs.\nThe Hidden Costs of Free Tests\nThe state offers “free” reading tests to schools, so money won’t stop them from using them. But these “free” tests actually cost schools more in the end. Schools must spend time training teachers, filling out reports, and following new rules. The hidden costs are much higher than just buying their own tests.\nThe Core Issue\nAll of these rules make it seem like education is getting better. But they actually make things worse by taking away the freedom, teamwork, and local choices that help kids learn best. The state is taking control over decisions that parents, teachers, and local schools used to make together."

    "section": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results",
    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe special education policies in HB2 Article 4 may seem like good ideas until you think about them. However, they could actually harm students with disabilities. These policies are labeled as “comprehensive” and “supportive,” but they will likely cause more problems than they solve.\nThese sections are object lessons in wasting our most precious resource - time.\nMore Rules, Less Flexibility for Schools\nThe expansion of services for visual and hearing impairments promises to help students. But these changes require more state funding and more rules (Code C in 100% of cases). They also take away local control (Code F in 100% of cases). Schools that understand their students best will now have to follow state rules, which may not work for each child.\nFederal Rules Create Extra Work\nThe updates to IEP committees and eligibility rules are meant to help schools follow federal laws. But these changes add more paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases), making it harder for teachers to focus on teaching. Schools that have built trust with families will be forced to change everything just to meet new rules, instead of focusing on helping children.\nA Bigger System Means More Problems\nThe plan to restructure the special education system aims to improve services statewide. But this creates more dependence on state funding (Code C) and adds tons of paperwork (Code E). These new requirements waste resources and delay help for students who need it now. Instead of better services, this new system costs more but offers less support.\nMonitoring Wastes Resources\nThe new monitoring systems and penalties are meant to ensure accountability. However, they focus on “accountability theater” rather than making real improvements (Code D in 45% of cases). Schools will spend millions just to prove they are following the rules. The people evaluating them may have little or no experience working with students with disabilities, which leads to more paperwork without actually improving teaching.\nLanguage Barriers Lead to More Paperwork\nThe new rules for translating documents are supposed to help non-English speaking families. What they do is add more paperwork (Code E). This slows down communication instead of improving it. Instead of having real conversations with families, schools will focus on translating forms and following procedures.\nTraining Rules Make Teacher Shortages Worse\nNew rules for regional service centers are meant to solve the teacher shortage in special education. But these rules make schools even more dependent on state bureaucracy (Code C in 100% of cases). This drives experienced teachers away from the field. Instead of supporting teachers who work with students, these policies create jobs that focus on compliance rather than teaching, which worsens the teacher shortage.\nFocus on Compliance, Not Individual Needs\nThe new diploma requirements for special education are supposed to ensure individualized teaching. But these policies treat teachers and families as the problem (Code G in 22.5% of cases) without fixing the system that they work in. Policies that claim to individualize education end up taking away the flexibility needed for truly personalized teaching.\nMore Bureaucracy Slows Services\nThe new requirements for memorandums of understanding between education and human services agencies promise better coordination. But they only add more layers of bureaucracy, creating more paperwork (Code E). This slows down services for families who are already struggling to navigate multiple systems.\nConclusion\nThese policies hurt students with disabilities. Instead of focusing on professional judgment, they replace it with compliance checks. They replace strong family relationships with endless paperwork. They replace individualized programs with more government control.\nThese policies assume that students will be better served by state rules rather than by teachers who know them well and work closely with their families. They take away local decision-making and harm the stable relationships that are key to good special education services.\nAs expected, these policies create an expensive bloated system that wastes tens of millions of dollars in state funding. It trains administrators and consultants to deal with bureaucracy, but not to build meaningful relationships with students, families, and communities.\nIn the end, these policies hurt the very students they are supposed to help, while enriching the compliance consultants and government workers who unwittingly will benefit from the system. Most will have good intentions."

    "section": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results",
    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe policies in HB2 Article 4, which focus on special education, may seem like good ideas, but they could actually make things worse. These policies are called “student support” and “federal compliance,” but they can hurt local control and the ability to help students effectively. Based on my analysis, all of these policies lead to more state control and less flexibility for educators who know the students best.\nCommunity Support That Limits Family Control\nThe Community Support Services Grant Programs promise to help families with services like in-home support and behavioral care. But these programs increase dependency on state funding (Code C in 100% of cases) and take away families’ control over how to help their own children (Code F in 100% of cases). It’s like forcing families to ask the government for permission before they can get help, turning natural problem-solving into more rules and paperwork.\nHospital Education That Makes Things Harder\nThe Hospital Education Student Service Classifications are meant to help students keep learning while they are getting medical treatment. But these rules create more state control (Code F in 100% of hospital policies), making things harder for schools, hospitals, and families who already have successful partnerships. Instead of focusing on healing, students will face more bureaucracy. It’s like making patients fill out school forms before they can get treated in the hospital.\nFunding That Creates Confusion, Not Help\nThe Special Education Service Group Allotment System and Transition Funding Formula promise to distribute money fairly to schools. But these policies make things worse by creating lots of paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases) and rewarding compliance rather than improving services (Code A in 80% of cases). Instead of helping students, this creates a complicated system where the money never reaches classrooms, while consultants profit from the confusion.\nDyslexia Support That Isn’t Really Individualized\nThe Dyslexia Program Allotment Requirements seem to target help to students with dyslexia. However, these policies make students follow one-size-fits-all approaches (Code G in 22.5% of cases) instead of personalizing support for each child. These policies promise to help students individually, but they actually take away the flexibility needed to address each child’s unique needs.\nEmpowering Parents, But Making Them Pay for Help\nThe Special Education Representative Qualifications and Grant Eligibility Criteria aim to improve parent advocacy, but they often end up benefiting professional advocates more than families (Code A in 85% of cases). Instead of empowering parents to understand their children’s needs, these rules create a special education industry where families must pay for help to navigate complex systems. It’s like making parents hire lawyers just to order coffee.\nIEP Facilitation That Makes Problems Worse\nThe IEP Facilitation Program Administration is supposed to help resolve disputes with independent facilitators. But these programs take away local control (Code F in 100% of cases) and disrupt relationships between families and schools. Districts that have built trust over the years will now have to include state-approved facilitators in important conversations about their children’s needs. It’s like making marriage counselors sit in on every family dinner.\nFederal Compliance That Hurts Local Control\nThe funding formulas and service rules are supposed to help schools comply with federal mandates. But these policies take away local decision-making (Code F in 100% of cases), making it harder for schools to make the best decisions for their students. It’s like requiring hospitals to get federal approval before treating patients. These policies assume that students with disabilities are better served by state rules than by teachers and professionals who know the children and their families.\nConclusion\nThese policies take away the local control and professional relationships that are crucial for effective special education. Instead of letting teachers and families work together, they replace personal connections with rules, paperwork, and state control.\nIt’s like trying to improve restaurants by forcing chefs to get approval from critics before every meal. These policies assume that students with disabilities will be better served by regulations than by educators who know them well.\nThey weaken the relationships, decision-making, and flexibility that are essential for successful education. At the same time, they create a costly, bureaucratic system that wastes millions in state funding while helping few students. The only ones who benefit are the consultants and administrators who profit from the chaos."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe policies in HB2 Article 3, which focus on teacher jobs and classroom management, might seem like good ideas, but they can actually make things worse. These policies are called “teacher protections” and “student safety measures,” but they are likely to cause more problems than they solve.\nTeacher Protection Becomes State Control Over Local Schools\nProtections for teachers who need to quit due to family emergencies or moving for their spouse’s job sound helpful. But these policies will take away local control (Code F in 100% of cases) and make schools more dependent on the state (Code C in 100% of cases). Schools shouldn’t need state permission to solve problems with their teachers.\nEmergency Hiring Rules That Make Emergencies Harder\nEmergency hiring rules are supposed to help schools hire teachers quickly when someone quits unexpectedly. But they make things slower by adding more rules and paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases). It’s like making fire departments fill out forms while trying to put out a fire.\nTeacher Quality Programs Turn Teaching Into Money Collection\nQuality assistance programs give teachers $1,000 or more for attending training and following state rules. But they encourage teachers to focus on getting money instead of helping students (Code A in 35% of cases). These programs turn teaching into earning rewards, instead of focusing on education.\nStudent Safety Rules That Remove Teacher Authority\nStudent removal and threat assessment systems are meant to help teachers keep students safe. But they take away the quick decision-making power teachers need (Code F in 100% of cases). These policies create extra rules that delay actions when teachers need to act fast.\nCertification Help That Creates More State Dependency\nFee waivers and test changes are meant to help more people become bilingual and special education teachers by removing money barriers. But they make schools more dependent on state funding (Code C in 100% of cases) and create systems that could disappear when political priorities change.\nWorkplace Rights That Add More Bureaucracy\nGrievance procedures give employees more rights, but they add more paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases) and do nothing to fix the real problems that cause conflicts in the first place. They only treat the symptoms, not the cause.\nData Collection That Wastes Time and Money\nTeacher time studies and position data collection are supposed to help improve workloads and retention by gathering information. But they waste resources (found in 17% of cases) and create reports that sit unused while teachers continue to struggle with the same issues these studies claim to solve.\nRetiree Programs That Game the System\nPrograms that pay districts to hire retired teachers seem to solve teacher shortages. But they only create temporary fixes and encourage people to game the system instead of addressing the real reasons why teachers are retiring early.\nConclusion\nThese policies hurt the development of good teaching. Instead of helping teachers focus on helping students, they create a system where teachers and principals are focused on following state rules and getting rewards. They weaken local decision-making and hurt relationships between teachers, administrators, and communities.\nMost importantly, these policies assume that teachers and school leaders care more about outside rules than their own professional judgment and job satisfaction. They take away local control, strong work relationships, and classroom authority — the things that create good learning environments.\nIn the end, these policies don’t help students. They create an expensive system that trains teachers to deal with bureaucracy instead of building real relationships with students, families, and communities. The only people who benefit are the consultants and state bureaucrats who profit from the mess."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Workforce Training Disguised as Education Reform\nThis law transforms public education into a state-controlled workforce training system that treats students as economic units rather than developing minds. Here are the main unintended results:\nEducation Turns into ‘Big Brother’ Data Collection\nThe new system for tracking postsecondary outcomes forces schools to track students for 10 years after graduation. Schools must report data on employment, wages, and where students live. This turns education into a system of surveillance instead of learning. What students do after graduation is none of our business!\nState Control Through “Readiness” Goals\nNew education goals explicitly prioritize immediate workforce entry over intellectual development. Schools must now focus on producing workers with state-approved credentials rather than educated citizens.\nCounselors Become Job Advisors\nSchool counselors now have to spend their time giving students state-required information about jobs, training, and wages. This takes away from the counseling support students need for personal challenges.\nPlans and Paperwork Over Teaching\nSchools must create detailed plans for college, career, and military readiness. They also have to hold public meetings and post reports online. This creates a huge amount of extra work that takes resources away from actually teaching students.\nCompeting for Limited Funds\nMany grant programs force schools to compete for limited state funding. This hurts collaboration within and between districts and makes them follow state rules to get money.\nThe Real Problem: Education Will Becomes Job Training\nThese rules change education from teaching critical thinking and citizenship into training workers for jobs. The state controls what skills matter, how success is measured, and which programs get money. Local communities lose the ability to decide what is best for their own children."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results\nThe rules in Article 4 about helping students with language learning and hearing or vision problems will not work as expected. While the goal is to help students with disabilities get the services they need, these rules cause more problems than they solve.\nInstead of giving schools more freedom to help students, these rules will take away local control and create too much paperwork. Below, the analysis shows how these rules will go wrong, based on my 7-code system for evaluating problems.\nThe Testing Trap: More Paperwork, Less Teaching\nThe law says it will help young deaf and hard-of-hearing children improve their language skills, but it will actually create a huge system to collect data. Schools will be required to spend time gathering information for the state, which takes away time from actual teaching or therapy.\nTeachers will have to focus on filling out even MORE reports taking away the value work of direct teaching with students. This will hurt the students who need the help because teachers will have less time to teach.\nThe One-Size-Does-NOT-Fit-All Problem\nThe law says districts must offer personalized help for students with hearing or vision problems, but it also forces schools to follow the same rules for every student. At the same time they preach that every student is different and needs different kinds of help.\nSchools will lose the ability to make education plans that differ very much for each student. Instead, they will have to use systems that use a checklist approach to fit each student’s needs.\nTaking Away Even More Local Decisions\nThe law says it will help kids with hearing and vision problems get services in their own communities. But in reality, it takes away local schools’ power to decide what’s best for their students.\nTeachers and school leaders who know their students best will have less say in important decisions. Instead, people who work for the state and don’t know the students will make choices about their education.\nEven More Paperwork, Less Time for Students\nThe law says it wants to make special education better by requiring experts like braille teachers and mobility specialists. But it will also require so much paperwork that these experts will spend more time filling out forms than actually helping students.\nInstead of focusing on students, these professionals will be busy with administrative tasks. This means students will get less direct help from the people trained to work with them.\nConfusing Reports Instead of Clear Communication\nThe law says it will make education clearer by requiring public reports on how students are doing. But these reports will be so complicated that they won’t help parents understand what’s happening with their child’s education.\nParents will find it harder, not easier, to understand how their child is doing in school. Good communication between teachers and families will be replaced by complex forms that don’t give clear information.\nWhy These Problems Will Happen\nThese issues show that the law doesn’t understand how good systems can work. Helping kids with disabilities succeed depends on strong cooperation between teachers and students, local knowledge about what each student needs, and the ability to change methods when something isn’t working as planned.\nThe law forces too many rules and reports instead of helping schools meet students’ real needs. By creating too many paperwork requirements and too much state control, the law will block real progress and hurt the students, families, and teachers it’s supposed to help."

    "text": "Opinionated Executive Summary: Testing Replaces Teaching, Data Replaces Education\nThis law transforms Texas public education into a test-driven, data-obsessed system that measures everything except actual learning. Here are the main unintended results:\nEducation Becomes About Numbers, Not Learning\nThe new accountability system adds more ways to measure schools but fails to focus on what really matters: student learning. Some schools will be forced to focus on numbers that improve their ratings rather than improving education itself.\nExchanging Liberty for Industry Certifications Mandates\nThe state now has a list of “approved” industry certifications that count for accountability. This turns schools into places where students collect certificates, rather than places where they build real skills and knowledge.\nFunding Depends on Following Rules, Not Education\nSchools now have to meet state-defined goals and use state-approved programs to get funding. This forces schools to choose between teaching students and getting the money they need.\nData Collection Takes Over\nSchools must track graduates for years, collect information about their jobs, and report their wages. Schools become data collection centers instead of places where students learn. This is an outrageous requirement. Only an ‘intellectual’ could come up with it.\nCompetition Replaces Working Together\nLimited funding forces people to compete with each other for resources. This stops them from working together; cooperation to improve the system of learning. It artificially creates winners and losers.\nThe Biggest Problem: Measuring Over Improving\nThese rules create a system that focuses on measuring things rather than improving them. The state decides what gets measured, how it’s measured, and what counts as success. Local communities lose the ability to decide what makes education good for their own children."
